This is my attempt at trying to get my hands dirty with Django Rest Framework while working with PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Docker etc to build APIs for an online bike store.

## Aim
Here I am listing a few of the features that I hope to incorporate in this project:
- APIs that can allow the users, to log in and signup
- APIs that can let him and his staff members update the inventory
- APIs with which users can purchase a bike, Both ONLINE and OFFLINE payment modes are available.
- APIs to handle order cancellation and refund
- APIs where the users can see their previously ordered bikes and how much warranty is left.
- APIs that can book a servicing appointment for a user
- Once an appointment has been booked someone from Johnâ€™s team would eventually assign a technician to handle the bike servicing.
- The same person would also add an expected time by which the bike servicing will be completed.
- APIs to handle the payment for booking a servicing appointment, Both Online and Offline payment     modes are available. (Bypass Payment Gateway)
- A python script that can generate invoices for the orders that will be created by
the application. This script will be continuously listening for messages coming to a RabbitMQ/Redis queue. As soon as a message is pushed to the queue, this script will pull the message, extract the essential user details from the message, and then create a PDF out of that data, and store the file somewhere in the filesystem.
